## LoveNotes

This is the project from [the blog post at Emily Platzer Makes Things](http://emily-platzer-makes-things.herokuapp.com/2014/04/28/basic-sinatra-ruby-rspec.html). It is a basic Ruby Sinatra App using testing driven development with rspec and capybara, and utilizes an array to store a list of "Love Notes".
